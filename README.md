## Introduction
This data visualization exercise charts the on time performace of the top US airlines for a decade and also plots a chart to look at different reasons contributing to delay.

##Summary
I downloaded the data from [BTS] (http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp), selecting a dataset that included all domestic flights from all carriers to and from major airports from June 2003 through December 2015. On performing an exploratory analysis of the data I found that the data is very detailed and has information for many airlines (20-25), therefore after an initial analysis I decided to plot the on time percentages for the top 5 airlines. 

On inteviewing one of my colleagues he mentioned that it would be nice if I could also plot a similar chart for different causes of delay. This would make the analysis and visualization complete and self explanatory. Therefore, I put another chart showing the different causes of delay and how they have changed over the last decade.
